# Introduction
This tutorial will illustrate how to use standalone tools, together with R and Bioconductor for the analysis of RNA-seq data. Keep in mind that this is a rapidly evolving field and that this document is not intended as a review of the many tools available to perform each step; instead, we will cover one of the many existing workflows to analyse this type of data.

We will be working with a subset of a publicly available dataset from *Drosophila melanogaster*, which is available both in the Short Read archive ([SRP001537](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/SRP001537) - raw data) and in Bioconductor ([pasilla package](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/pasilla.html) - processed data). For more information about this dataset please refer to the original publication ([Brooks et al. 2010](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2010/10/04/gr.108662.110)).

The tools and R packages that we will be using during the practical are listed below (see [Software requirements](https://github.com/mgonzalezporta/TeachingMaterial#software-requirements)) and the necessary data files can be found [here](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~mar/courses/RNAseq.tar.gz). After dowloading and uncompressing the `tar.gz` file, you should have the following directory structure in yuor computer:

```
RNAseq
|-- reference               # reference info (e.g. genome sequence and annotation)
`-- data
    |-- raw                 # raw data: fastq files
    |-- mapped              # mapped data: BAM files
    `-- demultiplexing      # extra fastq files for the demultiplexing section

```
